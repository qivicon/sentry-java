Android
=======

Features
--------

The Sentry Android SDK is built on top of the main Java SDK and supports all of the same
features, `configuration options <https://docs.sentry.io/clients/java/config/>`_, and more.
Adding version ``1.5.4`` of the Android SDK to a sample application that doesn't even use
Proguard only increased the release ``.apk`` size by approximately 200KB.

Events will be `buffered to disk <https://docs.sentry.io/clients/java/config/#buffering-events-to-disk>`_
(in the application's cache directory) by default. This allows events to be sent at a
later time if the device does not have connectivity when an event is created. This can
be disabled by :ref:`setting the option <configuration>` ``buffer.enabled`` to ``false``.

An ``UncaughtExceptionHandler`` is configured so that crash events will be
stored to disk and sent the next time the application is run.

The ``AndroidEventBuilderHelper`` is enabled by default, which will automatically
enrich events with data about the current state of the device, such as memory usage,
storage usage, display resolution, connectivity, battery level, model, Android version,
whether the device is rooted or not, etc.

Installation
------------

Using Gradle (Android Studio) in your ``app/build.gradle`` add:

.. sourcecode:: groovy

    compile 'io.sentry:sentry-android:1.5.4'

For other dependency managers see the `central Maven repository <https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.sentry%7Csentry-android%7C1.5.4%7Cjar>`_.

Initialization
--------------

Your application must have permission to access the internet in order to send
events to the Sentry server. In your ``AndroidManifest.xml``:

.. sourcecode:: xml

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

Then initialize the Sentry client in your application's main ``onCreate`` method:

.. sourcecode:: java

    import io.sentry.Sentry;
    import io.sentry.android.AndroidSentryClientFactory;

    public class MainActivity extends Activity {
        @Override
        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

            Context ctx = this.getApplicationContext();

            // Use the Sentry DSN (client key) from the Project Settings page on Sentry
            String sentryDsn = "https://publicKey:secretKey@host:port/1?options";
            Sentry.init(sentryDsn, new AndroidSentryClientFactory(ctx));

            // Alternatively, if you configured your DSN in a `sentry.properties`
            // file (see the configuration documentation).
            Sentry.init(new AndroidSentryClientFactory(ctx));
        }
    }

You can optionally configure other values such as ``environment`` and ``release``.
:ref:`See the configuration page <configuration>` for ways you can do this.

Usage
-----

Now you can use ``Sentry`` to capture events anywhere in your application:

.. sourcecode:: java

    import io.sentry.context.Context;
    import io.sentry.event.BreadcrumbBuilder;
    import io.sentry.event.UserBuilder;

    public class MyClass {
        /**
         * An example method that throws an exception.
         */
        void unsafeMethod() {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("You shouldn't call this!");
        }

        /**
         * Note that the ``Sentry.init`` method must be called before the static API
         * is used, otherwise a ``NullPointerException`` will be thrown.
         */
        void logWithStaticAPI() {
            /*
            Record a breadcrumb in the current context which will be sent
            with the next event(s). By default the last 100 breadcrumbs are kept.
            */
            Sentry.getContext().recordBreadcrumb(
                new BreadcrumbBuilder().setMessage("User made an action").build()
            );

            // Set the user in the current context.
            Sentry.getContext().setUser(
                new UserBuilder().setEmail("hello@sentry.io").build()
            );

            /*
            This sends a simple event to Sentry using the statically stored instance
            that was created in the ``main`` method.
            */
            Sentry.capture("This is a test");

            try {
                unsafeMethod();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // This sends an exception event to Sentry using the statically stored instance
                // that was created in the ``main`` method.
                Sentry.capture(e);
            }
        }
    }

ProGuard
--------

In order to use ProGuard with Sentry you will need to upload
the proguard mapping files to Sentry by using our Gradle integration
(recommended) or manually by using :doc:`sentry-cli </learn/cli/proguard>`

Gradle Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Gradle (Android Studio) in your ``app/build.gradle`` add:

.. sourcecode:: groovy

    apply plugin: 'io.sentry.android.gradle'

And declare a dependency in your toplevel ``build.gradle``:

.. sourcecode:: groovy

    buildscript {
        dependencies {
            classpath 'io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin:1.5.4'
        }
    }

The plugin will then automatically generate appropriate ProGuard mapping files
and upload them when you run ``gradle assembleRelease``.  The credentials
for the upload step are loaded from a ``sentry.properties`` file in
your project root *or* via environment variables, for more information
`see the sentry-cli documentation <https://docs.sentry.io/learn/cli/configuration/#configuration-values>`_.
At the very minimum you will need something like this::

    defaults.project=___PROJECT_NAME___
    defaults.org=___ORG_NAME___
    auth.token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

You can find your authentication token `on the Sentry API page <https://sentry.io/api/>`_.
For more information about the available configuration options see
`/learn/cli/configuration`.

Gradle Configuration
````````````````````

Additionally we expose a few configuration values directly in Gradle:

.. sourcecode:: groovy

    sentry {
        // Disables or enables the automatic configuration of proguard
        // for Sentry.  This injects a default config for proguard so
        // you don't need to do it manually.
        autoProguardConfig true

        // Enables or disables the automatic upload of mapping files
        // during a build.  If you disable this you'll need to manually
        // upload the mapping files with sentry-cli when you do a release.
        autoUpload true
    }

Manual Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you choose not to use the Gradle integration, you may handle the processing
and upload steps manually. However, it is highly recommended that you use the
Gradle integration if at all possible.

First, you need to add the following to your ProGuard rules file::

    -keepattributes LineNumberTable,SourceFile
    -dontwarn org.slf4j.**
    -dontwarn javax.**

ProGuard UUIDs
``````````````

After ProGuard files are generated you will need to embed the UUIDs of the
ProGuard mapping files in a properties file named ``sentry-debug-meta.properties`` in
the assets folder.  The Java SDK will look for the UUIDs there to link events to
the correct mapping files on the server side.

.. admonition:: Note

    Sentry calculates UUIDs for proguard files.  For more information
    about how this works see :ref:`proguard-uuids`.

``sentry-cli`` can write the ``sentry-debug-meta.properties`` file for you::

    sentry-cli upload-proguard \
        --android-manifest app/build/intermediates/manifests/full/release/AndroidManifest.xml \
        --write-properties app/build/intermediates/assets/release/sentry-debug-meta.properties \
        --no-upload \
        app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt

Note that this file needs to be in your APK, so this needs to be run before
the APK is packaged.  You can do that by creating a gradle task that runs
before the dex packaging.

You can for example add a gradle task after the proguard step and before
the dex one which executes ``sentry-cli`` to validate and process
the mapping files and to write the UUIDs into the properties file:

.. sourcecode:: groovy

    gradle.projectsEvaluated {
        android.applicationVariants.each { variant ->
            def variantName = variant.name.capitalize();
            def proguardTask = project.tasks.findByName(
                "transformClassesAndResourcesWithProguardFor${variantName}")
            def dexTask = project.tasks.findByName(
                "transformClassesWithDexFor${variantName}")
            def task = project.tasks.create(
                    name: "processSentryProguardFor${variantName}",
                    type: Exec) {
                workingDir project.rootDir
                commandLine *[
                    "sentry-cli",
                    "upload-proguard",
                    "--write-properties",
                    "${project.rootDir.toPath()}/app/build/intermediates/assets" +
                        "/${variant.dirName}/sentry-debug-meta.properties",
                    variant.getMappingFile(),
                    "--no-upload"
                ]
            }
            dexTask.dependsOn task
            task.dependsOn proguardTask
        }
    }

Alternatively you can generate a UUID upfront yourself and then force
Sentry to honor that UUID after upload.  However this is strongly
discouraged!

Uploading ProGuard Files
````````````````````````

Finally, you need manually upload ProGuard files with ``sentry-cli`` as
follows::

    sentry-cli upload-proguard \
        --android-manifest app/build/intermediates/manifests/full/release/AndroidManifest.xml \
        app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt
